        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a passionate web developer with a growing interest in the field of cybersecurity, particularly ethical hacking. Over the past few years, I've honed my skills in web development, building responsive, user-friendly applications using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Now, I'm expanding my knowledge to ethical hacking to better understand and defend against security threats in the software I develop.<br>
            By learning ethical hacking, I aim to bridge the gap between development and security, ensuring the applications I create are robust and secure. My goal is to not only write clean, efficient code but also to build solutions that prioritize user privacy and data protection. With a hacker mindset and a developer's toolkit, I'm dedicated to contributing to safer digital spaces.
